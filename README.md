# INFX 551 Foundations of Data Curation

First steps: 

1. `Fork` this repository 
2. Add me `nniiicc`  and your teammates as a collaborator 
3. Change this read me file. Add the title of your project, and a brief description. 

There are a number of folders, and I suggest keeping the file strucutre as I have arranged it. This inlcudes: 

1. Code: You can put any software that you have used for your final project. This is 100% optional - you may not use or write any code for this project. 
2. Data: Add curated datasets - more specific instructions forthcoming
3. Documentation: Any additional documentaiton (data dictionary, etc.) should go here. 
4. Final Report: 
5. Use-Cases: For your second assignment you will write up a case study related to the quarter long-project. I'd like you to place all of these in the same folder. If you write this document as a `.doc` you can use an online [tool](https://word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com/) to convert to markdown `.md`.
